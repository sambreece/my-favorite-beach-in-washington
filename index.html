        <p>Wikipedia says:</p>
        <blockquote cite = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Push_Beach#Second_Beach">Trails to Second Beach (47.8839°N 124.6155°W[10]) start at the Quileute Indian Reservation, and span 1 mile (1.6 km) before reaching the coast. Second Beach is the longest and flattest of the three beaches and is the most populated. Though within a mile of First and Third Beach in each direction, north and south, the other beaches are inaccessible because of protruding headlands and steep bluffs. </blockquote>
